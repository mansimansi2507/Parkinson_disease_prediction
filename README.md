# Parkinson_disease_prediction
Parkinson's disease prediction project of data science 
Parkinson's disease is a disorder that affects the nervous system and parts of the body controlled by nerves. Symptoms are also not that much noticeable. Signs of stiffening, tremors, and slowing of movements may be signs of Parkinsonâ€™s disease. There is no certain way to accurately find whether a person has Parkinson's disease or not so we use machine learning to predict if a person has Parkinson's disease or not.
In this project, first I collected Parkinson's dataset from the UCI machine learning repository.
Then I analyze that data and I found that data is not balanced so I balanced the data by using sampling and then I visualize the data.
After all this, I split the data into train and test data and then standardize the data.
And I applied various machine learning algorithms (like- Logistic Regression, Support Vector algorithm, Random Forest, Naive Byes, XGBoost, Decision Tree) to check whether a person has Parkinson's disease or not.
Thank you...
